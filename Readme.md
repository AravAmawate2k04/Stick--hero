# Stick Hero Game

## How to Run the Code
To play the game, navigate to the `HelloApplication` class and run it.

## How to Play
- Click on the play button in the middle to start the game.
- If the stick lands correctly, the player wins!

## Features Implemented

### **Design Patterns & Multithreading**
- Implemented the **Singleton Pattern** in the `StickHero` function to ensure controlled object creation.
- Integrated **Multithreading** to handle media playback seamlessly, enhancing the gaming experience.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**
- **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism** are effectively used in the `StickHero` and `Stick` classes.
- The `Stick` class extends `Rectangle`, providing additional functionality like rotation and extension.
- The `StickHero` class efficiently controls the player's movement across the stick.

### **Game Logic & Mechanics**
- Designed a **functional game prototype** where the player either wins or loses based on precise stick placement.
- Smooth character transition across the stick for an engaging experience.

### **Data Persistence**
- **Serialization and Deserialization** are implemented in the `StoreGame` class to save and retrieve game data efficiently.

This project demonstrates strong software design principles, effective use of Java concepts, and an engaging gameplay experience!
